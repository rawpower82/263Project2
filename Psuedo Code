Project Overview:
    We will design a program which calculate the total cost of owning different cars over a period
    of time. 

Milestones:
    Calculate the total cost of owning each car over a period of 5 years
        Use the MPG, Total Cost, and depreciation of the car.
        Graph the results using a bar graph
    Add in subclasses of cars
        Trucks, Cars, Hybrids, Electric
        Fuel Types: Deisel, gas, electricity
    Calculate the total cost of owning each car over different periods of time
        Graph the results of each car's total cost over time.
    Add in more variables:
        Cash vs. Loan 
        Brand
        Foreign vs. Domestic


Psuedo Code:
    Import Packages: Numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc
    Main Menu Options: 
    Create Classes: Trucks, Cars, Hybrids, Electric
    User Inputs: Upfront cost, brand, type of vehicle, loan vs cahs?, foreign vs domestic?, fuel type
    Calculate cost of owning each car
    Present results: plots
