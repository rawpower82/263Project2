Hey Guys, I totally spaced that this was due tonight. Here's what I put:

We all feel that on this project we did a better job with communicating as a group. 
We met together on different occasions and we were more efficient about updating our code on GitHub. 
We made sure that we had each otherâ€™s phone numbers and we texted about our project periodically.

I think that I could still improve on communicating about how I would like to implement code so that expectations for each group member are more clear. 
We all had our assignments this time, but we still feel that our assignments could have been better coordinated. 



Zach: Great job solving the model for depreciation. It was really easy to impliment your code into the main file.

Kraig: Your calculations for fuel and total costs made it easy for me to just double check the units when putting the 
calculations into the main code.

Ways to improve: I'm sorry if I made things too complicated to impliment things into the main code, but it would be really useful 
if we could all consistently update the main code rather than just posting code as a separate file it GitHub. Also, sometimes
the code each of you posted wouldn't compile. It would be good to debug your code while it is still small and simple.
